# Implementation

We provide both code bases needed to run and recreate our experimental results.  
In the folder `TraVaS` the complete `TraVaS` algorithm including its `uTraVaS` extension can be found
as a Python package. For installation and usage, we refer to the separate readme file.  
The folder `sacofa` contains the Python code required for evaluating our SaCoFa results.
For this purpose, both inner directories must be placed at the same location as the main scripts.
Note that we only adopted and changed the SaCoFa code from the original source to allow for &delta;>0
parameter settings.
