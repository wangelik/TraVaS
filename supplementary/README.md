In this folder we provide all supplementary material for the *TraVaS* paper as separate pdf files.  
The following topics are discussed:

* Data Utility Metrics: Motivation, evaluation and detailed derivation of our two data utility metrics, *relative log similarity* and *absolute log difference* ([PDF](metrics.pdf)).
* Computational Complexity: Runtime analysis of the *SQVR* and the *TraVaS optimizer* algorithms ([PDF](complexity.pdf)).

Note that all material refers to the same authorship and licensing as the main paper.
