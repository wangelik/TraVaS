# Supplementary Material

In this folder we provide all supplementary material for the *TraVaS* paper as separate pdf files.  
The following topics are discussed:

* uTraVaS: Algorithm design and experimental results of our *uTraVaS* optimizer extension ([PDF](uTravas.pdf)).
* Data Utility Metrics: Motivation, evaluation and detailed derivation of our two data utility metrics, *relative log similarity* and *absolute log difference* ([PDF](metrics.pdf)).
* Computational Complexity: Runtime analysis of the *TraVaS* and the *uTraVaS* algorithms ([PDF](complexity.pdf)).

Note that all material refers to the same authorship and licensing as the main paper.
