# Data Utility Metrics

*Data-utility*-based metrics primarily aim at assessing the similarity between original and anonymized data without computing intermediate data abstractions such as statistical models. In the context of process mining a prominent method is to compare the respective variant distributions of two event logs in a meaningful manner. We demonstrate that these distribution-oriented algorithms can be complemented with methods analyzing event logs based on absolute statistics. The underlying challenge rather lies in the interpretation of similarity and data quality which in turn depends on the data sources, -structure and experimental setup. To illustrate this ambiguity we additionally discuss brief examples.
